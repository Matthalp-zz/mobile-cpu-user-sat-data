### Introduction

The data in this spreadsheet is a companion to the paper:

M. Halpern, Y. Zhu, V. J. Reddi, **"Mobile CPU's Rise to Power: Quantifying the Impact of Generational Mobile CPU Design Trends on Performance, Energy, and User Satisfaction"**, in the 22nd
Symposium on High Performance Computer Architecture (HPCA), March, 2016.

The data is presented as a CSV with the following columns:

| Column      | Description                                  |
|-------------|----------------------------------------------|
| id          | MTurk worker unique identifier (anonymized)  |
| url         | URL to YouTube video worker rated            |
| rating      | Satisfaction rating 1 - 5 (higher is better) |
| accept_time | Time worker completed survey                 |
| ip          | Worker IP address (anonymized)               |
| benchmark   | The application rated                        |
| cpu_cores   | CPU cores enabled (1, 2, 3, 4)               |
| cpu_freq    | CPU frequency in MHz <br/> (422.4, 729.6, 1036.8, 1497.6, 1958.4, 2457.6) |   
| gpu_freq    | GPU frequency in MHz <br/> (200, 320, 389, 462.4, 578) |
